Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
She's starin' at me
I'm sittin' wonderin'
what she's thinkin'
Mmmmm
Nobody's talkin'
'Cause talkin'
just turns into screamin'
Ohhh
And now is
I'm yellin' over her
She's yellin' over me
All that that means
Is neither of us is listening
(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember
why were fighting
So both of us are mad for
Nothin'
(Fighting for)
Nothin'
(Crying for)
Nothin'
(Whoahhh)
But we won't let it go for
Nothin'
(No not for)
Nothin'
This should be nothin' to
a love like what we got
Ohhh baby
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep
through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you
to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you
to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Ohhh no no no
And it gets me upset girl
When you're
constantly accusing
(Askin' questions like
you've already known)
We're fighting this war baby
When both of us are losing
(This ain't the way
that love is supposed to go)
Whoaaaaaaaaa
What happened to workin' it out
We've falled into this place
Where you ain't backin' down
And I ain't backin' down
So what the hell do we do now
It's all for
Nothin'
(Fighting for)
Nothin'
(Crying for)
Nothin'
(Whoahhh)
But we won't let it go for
Nothin'
(No not for)
Nothin'
This should be nothin' to
a love like what we got
Ohhh baby
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep
through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)
Girl I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you
to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you
to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Ohhh no no no
Oh baby this love
ain't gonna be perfect
(Perfect perfect oh oh)
And just how good it's gonna be
We can't fuss and we can't fight
Long as everything
allright between us
Before we go to sleep
Baby we're gonna be happy
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
'Cause I can't sleep
through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)
Girl I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you
to go to bed
(Mad at me)
No, I don't wanna go to bed
(Mad at you)
And I don't want you
to go to bed
(Mad at me)
Ohhh no no no
